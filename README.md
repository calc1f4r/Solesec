## Project Structure

The main components of the project are:

- `app/`: Next.js 13 app directory
  - `page.tsx`: The main landing page component
  - `layout.tsx`: The root layout component
  - `globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `lib/`: Utility functions and shared logic
- `pages/api/`: API routes for serverless functions
- `public/`: Static assets

## How It Works

Our AI-powered Solana smart contract auditing process follows these steps:

1. Code Submission: Upload your Solana smart contracts through our secure interface.
2. AI Analysis: Our RAG agent performs a deep, automated analysis of your code, leveraging a vast knowledge base of Solana-specific vulnerabilities and best practices.
3. Vulnerability Detection: AI identifies potential security issues, optimizations, and compliance concerns specific to the Solana ecosystem.
4. Automated Report Generation: Receive a comprehensive, AI-generated audit report with detailed explanations and remediation suggestions.
5. Interactive Consultation: Use our "Chat with Code" feature to ask questions and receive clarifications directly from the AI about your audit results.
